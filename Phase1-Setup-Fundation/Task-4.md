## Hello Developers, Engineers & Innovators,

We are officially in Phase 1: Setup & Foundation of our Mini eCommerce Website project!

Task for Today:
Create your first GitHub repository and understand how it works. This is a foundational step in version control and team collaboration.

What is a GitHub Repository?
A repository (repo) is like a folder for your project. It stores your code, project files, and the history of all changes you or your team make. It's essential for tracking progress, collaborating with others, and deploying your work.

Step-by-Step Guide: How to Create a GitHub Repository
1. Log into your GitHub account
Visit https://github.com and sign in.

2. Click the '+' icon at the top-right corner of the page, then select "New repository".

3. Fill in the repository details:

- Repository name: (e.g., nebatech-phase1)

- Description: Briefly describe what the repo is for (optional).

- Public or Private: Choose Public so your teammates can view it.

- Initialize this repository with:

       - README file: Yes (Check the box)

       - Leave other options unchecked for now.

4. Click the green “*Create repository” button.

Share your GitHub repository link in the group once done.

Let’s keep building! If you’re ready, drop a ✅ once you have created your repository.
