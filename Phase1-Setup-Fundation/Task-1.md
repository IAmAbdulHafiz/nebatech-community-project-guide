You’ll need it for writing code, testing, and running your applications.

2.	Download and Install VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
Our main code editor for this project.

3.	Download and Install Git (for version control).

4.	Download and Install GitHub Desktop (for easier Git/GitHub interaction)

Once you’re done setting these up, drop a ✅ in the chat to show you’re ready.
